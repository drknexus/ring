Circular buffers in R and C.

There are two sorts of buffers implemented; a pure R circular buffer implemented as double linked list (using environments) that is genuinely circular, and one implemented in C that operates as an array of bytes.  Both can be used from R and I am looking for a way to make the C buffer available from other C packages without having to deal with dynamically loaded functions (being C rather than C++, being header-only is tricky but we might be able to fake it).
