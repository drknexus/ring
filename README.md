Circular buffers in R and C.

There are two sorts of buffers implemented; a pure R circular buffer implemented as double linked list (using environments) that is genuinely circular, and one implemented in C that operates as an array of bytes.  Both can be used from R, and the C one can be used in other packages using R's `LinkingTo:` support.
